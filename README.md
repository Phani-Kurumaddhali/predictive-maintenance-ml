Machine Learning project predicting equipment maintenance needs using simulated sensor data.
# 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to predict equipment maintenance needs based on operational and sensor data.

---

### 🎯 Objective
To use data-driven insights to **predict potential equipment failures** and schedule maintenance proactively — improving uptime and reducing costs.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Simulated dataset of equipment sensor readings  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, scaling, feature selection  
3. **Model Building:** Train Logistic Regression / Random Forest models  
4. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve  
5. **Outcome:** Predict if a machine is likely to fail within the next maintenance cycle
